# Resource-Management-Se
This is the repository containing resources for e-portfolio about RAII for software engineering course in 2021/2022.

## About RAII
RAII (Resource Allocation is Initialization) is a common-used pattern for resource management especially in higher programming languages (like C++, Rust, etc.). It is designed to avoid possible problems while using (finite) resources.

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites needed in order to attend this presentation.
We will use the [Godbolt Compiler Explorere](https://godbolt.org/) in order to talk about some possible applicances of RAII in C++.
Godbolt Compiler Explorer is a free-to-use online tool to compile and execute various programming languages with a broad variety of possibilities. For example, you are able to take a closer look at the generated assembler code and see which part belongs to the corresponding source code.
<br>
Thus, you won't need any other tool than a browser (and your attention), if you want to learn a little bit about RAII :).

## Trying on your own
If you want to take a closer look at the code used in this e-portfolio, you may want to copy the code in the Demo folder and paste it to the godbolt website.
In order to execute the code, you need to activate it by clicking on the settings wheel and ticking `Execute the code` option.
The output should be shown in a separate tab, however, if not shown, press the `Output` buttom in the bottom bar.
<br>
If any specific compiler flag is needed in order for the code to be executed, you will find it in the first few lines of the specific code example file. You can add compiler flags by inserting them into the `Compiler Options` input field.
<br> 
The files contain comments explaining some details in the code. (However, if you are having trouble understanding some segments, feel free to contact me, anyway.)

## Presentation
The presentation can be found in this repository.
